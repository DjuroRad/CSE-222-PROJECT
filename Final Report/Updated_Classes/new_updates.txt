Other than database is not implemented just comments and
some little changes was made.
While adding date instead of taking from user you can use system time.
tostring is important for data java automatic tostring is good to print.
You can update database class to reach your data.

There is no default constructor in Personnel class.
compareTo method in Personnel class should be implemented.
In database class, getPersonnel method gives error. Because the personnel class is abstract. 

(I noted it not to forget it.)
